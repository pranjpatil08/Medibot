# Medibot🩺
MediBot is a domain-specific medical document intelligence system that enables patients, students, and healthcare professionals to interactively query medical PDFs and receive accurate, context-grounded answers strictly sourced from their documents.

We’ve all opened a medical report and felt this:
pages of clinical terms
long paragraphs
numbers we don’t understand
and no clear answers

You shouldn’t be in a dilemma to understand your own health information.

So I built MediBot.🩺

1 Upload your reports
2 Ask questions naturally
3 Get answers only from your documents

Nothing invented.
Nothing guessed.

Just clarity.

✨Features:
1. Multi-PDF Upload📄: Upload multiple medical files at once.
2. Semantic Search🔍: Finds relevant information even if wording differs.
3. Conversational Q&A 💬: Ask questions naturally.
4. Source Citation📌: Shows where the answer came from.
5. Safety Guardrails🛡: Rejects non-document or diagnostic questions.
6. Domain-Specific Behavior🧠: Built specifically for healthcare documents.
